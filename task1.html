    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
